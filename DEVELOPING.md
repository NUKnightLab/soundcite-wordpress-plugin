We welcome contributions to this code. It's probably a good idea to start a
discussion around new features or bugs in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/soundcite/issues) before investing too
much time, just to make sure that your approach is in line with the team's
intentions for the project.

To keep the code tidy, we use PHP code linting formatting tools. (details TK)
